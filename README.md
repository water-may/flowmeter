# Flowmeter Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This repository contains tools and machine learning models for the analysis and processing of flowmeter data. It focuses on predicting flow rates and other metrics using data-driven approaches, including Random Forest and other classifiers.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models, including Random Forest classifiers.
- `src/`: Contains all Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `visualizations/`: Code for creating visual plots to understand the data and model performance.

## Features

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Scripts to clean and normalize flowmeter data, remove noise, and fill missing values.
- Feature extraction methods to transform raw data into useful input for machine learning models.

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- Implements Random Forest and potentially other classifiers for predicting flow metrics.
- Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation scripts.

### 3. Visualization
- Plotting functions to visualize flowmeter data and model results (e.g., flow rate distributions, prediction accuracy, confusion matrices).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/water-may/flowmeter.git
    ```
2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Processing
Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare your dataset:
bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/processed_data.csv

### Model Training
To train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data:
```bash
python src/train_model.py --data data/processed_data.csv --model models/random_forest.pkl
```

### Model Evaluation
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on test data:
```bash
python src/evaluate_model.py --model models/random_forest.pkl --test_data data/test_data.csv
```

### Visualization
Generate visualizations for data insights and model performance:
```bash
python src/visualize_results.py --input data/processed_data.csv --output visualizations/flow_plots.png
```

## Dataset

The flowmeter dataset used in this project is stored in the `data/` directory. Ensure that your data is structured properly (e.g., CSV format) before running the scripts.
